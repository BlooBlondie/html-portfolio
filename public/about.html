  <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Growing up I was always around computers and technology. A big gamer from a young age to this day.
  I am also curious, friendly, adaptive and willing to help wherever I can. I have a diverse background from customer service to varying financial positions.
  You could also say I was the team tech girl, whenever someones computer or monitor was acting up.</p>

<p>Currently, I am a stay at home mom to a wonderful one year old.
  While enjoying my time being a mom, I decided to look into a new career path.
  I may be tech savvy but I have not taken the next step into computer tech, until now.
  I am working on developing my coding skills and look forward to creating wonderful projects.</p>
